Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor

A real-time collaborative document editor that allows multiple users to create, edit, and sync documents simultaneously. The application provides a dynamic and responsive user interface built using modern frontend frameworks like React.js or Vue.js.

The backend is powered by scalable technologies such as Node.js, Django, or Flask to handle real-time communication, authentication, and document management. Data is securely stored using databases like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

This project demonstrates full-stack development, real-time data synchronization, and modern web application architecture.
